This project contains my POV-Ray "library" files and will contain example scene directories that demonstrate their use.

Initially, the brickwall.inc and all of its related files, as well as the required subsidiary library files are in the library directory.
Samples of using brickwall.inc are included in the "Brickwall Examples" folder.

All of these files were developed for POV-Ray 3.8 beta 2.
